# About Us

Beacon Programming was founded by myself (Jake Dean) and Anthony Nardi with the goal of teaching people how to program.
We went to school for Economics and Psychology respectively, but we both saw the value of programming after college
and quit our jobs to learn together. We were able to make some interesting projects and I later landed a job at Wayfair
and Anthony started at HubSpot. I have been a backend engineer at Wayfair for 5 years now working on real time streaming
systems and Anthony has been at HubSpot for 3 years working on the front end of the HubSpot CRM tool.

# Our Goal

The goal of Beacon Programming is to create a collaborative environment for people to learn to program. Anthony and I learned
together and the fact that we had each other to learn accelerated our development as programmers dramatically. We see a
niche in programming education somewhere in between a bootcamp and a full master's degree. We think bootcamps focus too much
on high level frameworks and not enough on low level fundamentals, at the same time we think that a full master's program is a
bit too theoretical and lengthy for people looking to get into the industry as soon as possible.

# Our Method

Our goal is for you to start writing interesting programs. We believe most learning comes from writing programs yourself, so we only teach you the fundamental tools to get there. Problems are at the end of each section. Read through in order and try to work through the problems.

An easy way to follow along is to use the Console in Google Chrome. The Console allows you to execute Javascript. The Console is found in the application menu `View->Developer->JavaScript Console`

## The Basics

These are the basic tools the Javascript programming language provides. Understanding these will enable you to write almost any program you can imagine!

- [Strings](basics/Strings)
- [Arrays](basics/Arrays)
- [Objects](basics/Objects)
- [Conditionals](basics/Conditionals)
- [Functions](basics/Functions)
- [Loops](basics/Loops)
- [Classes](basics/Classes)
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)

## Learning Activities

Once you understand the basics, it's time to put your understanding and creativity to the test! We have some programs that we have written ourselves for you to write yourself. While the code is available for you to look at, try your best to build these programs yourself first. Along the way we will introduce a few new concepts, such as HTML, CSS, Canvas, and a few others.

### What you'll need

All you need is a code editor. Feel free to use something as simple as Notepad or (my favorite) [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

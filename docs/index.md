# About Us

Beacon Programming was founded by myself (Jake Dean) and Anthony Nardi with the goal of teaching people how to program.
We went to school for Economics and Psychology respectively, but we both saw the value of programming after college
and quit our jobs to learn together. We were able to make some interesting projects and I later landed a job at Wayfair
and Anthony started at HubSpot. I have been a backend engineer at Wayfair for 5 years now working on real time streaming
systems and Anthony has been at HubSpot for 3 years working on the front end of the HubSpot CRM tool.

# Our Goal

The goal of Beacon Programming is to create a collaborative environment for people to learn to program. Anthony and I learned
together and the fact that we had each other to learn accelerated our development as programmers dramatically. We see a
niche in programming education somewhere in between a bootcamp and a full master's degree. We think bootcamps focus too much
on high level frameworks and not enough on low level fundamentals, at the same time we think that a full master's program is a
bit too theoretical and lengthy for people looking to get into the industry as soon as possible.

# Our Method

Our goal is for you to start writing interesting programs. We believe most learning comes from writing programs yourself, so we only teach you the fundamental tools to get there. Problems are at the end of each section. Read through in order and try to work through the problems.

## The Basics

These are the basic tools the Javascript programming language provides. Understanding these will enable you to write almost any program you can imagine!

### What you'll need
Create an account here https://codepen.io/. Coderpen allows you to follow along and build small programs without needing to download any software. It allows you to write Javascript, HTML, and CSS while seeing the results on the page immediately. Remeber to use `console.log()` in your Javascript to see the output of the arguments you pass into it logged to the console. If you have questions about this, please reach out!

## Learning Activities

Once you understand the basics, it's time to put your understanding and creativity to the test! We have some programs that we have written ourselves for you to write yourself. While the code is available for you to look at, try your best to build these programs yourself first. Along the way we will introduce a few new concepts, such as HTML, CSS, Canvas, and a few others. If you aren't familiar with HTML or CSS, we suggest going through the examples for each in the section you see below. We use HTML and CSS for all the projects we will build.

- [CSS Basics](https://github.com/jakedean/beacon-programming/tree/master/projects/css)

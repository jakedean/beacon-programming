# Projects

Once you understand the basics, it's time to put your understanding and creativity to the test! We have some programs that we have written ourselves for you to write yourself. While the code is available for you to look at, try your best to build these programs yourself first. Along the way we will introduce a few new concepts, such as HTML, CSS, Canvas, and a few others. If you aren't familiar with HTML or CSS, we suggest going through the examples for each in the section you see below. We use HTML and CSS for all the projects we will build.

## What you'll need

Codepen for learning the fundamentals is excellent, but for larger programs it isn't ideal. Learning to create new files and use a code editor such as Visual Studio Code will give you an experience that is closer to actual software engineering. If you have questions about this, please reach out! If you still want to use Codepen that is fine, you should be able to follow along easily either way.

# The Basics

These are the basic tools the Javascript programming language provides. Understanding these will enable you to write almost any program you can imagine!

## What you'll need

Create an account at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/){:target="\_blank"}. Codepen allows you to follow along and build small programs without needing to download any software. It allows you to write Javascript, HTML, and CSS while seeing the results on the page immediately. Remember to use `console.log()` in your Javascript to see the output of the arguments you pass into it. If you have questions about this, please reach out!

## Hints

Not all problems are easy to solve. We recommend the following approach.

1. Review the material each problem uses as part of the solution. For example if you see `Uses: Variables, Loops, Functions` you should be familiar with how to implement variables, loops, and functions.
2. Spend some time working on the problem. Experiment. Use `console.log` to see how things work.
3. Expand the "Hint" section. The hint sections provides a basic structure for how we think the problem can be solved.
4. Spend some more time working on the problem now that you have seen the hint.
5. If at this point you are not making progress, you can either reach out to Jake and Tony on slack. Consider moving on to another problem and revisiting the problems you get stuck on.

# CSS Basics

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) provides us with a way to describe how the HTML should be rendered. For example, CSS allows us to align text, change colors, and even animate!

## The Goal

Our goal is to understand the very basics of CSS enough to style the projects we will build to look a little nicer.

## Follow Along
Let me know what you think. Did I move to slow, to fast? Did I not explain something well, or at all? Any feedback is appreciated since I will improve the video and it will be a better experience for all students!

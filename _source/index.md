# About Us

Beacon Programming was founded by myself (Jake Dean) and Anthony Nardi with the goal of teaching people how to program.
We went to school for Economics and Psychology respectively, but we both saw the value of programming after college
and quit our jobs to learn together. We were able to make some interesting projects and I later landed a job at Wayfair
and Anthony started at HubSpot. I have been a backend engineer at Wayfair for 5 years now working on real time streaming
systems and Anthony has been at HubSpot for 3 years working on the front end of the HubSpot CRM tool.

# Our Goal

The goal of Beacon Programming is to create a collaborative environment for people to learn to program. Anthony and I learned
together and the fact that we had each other to learn accelerated our development as programmers dramatically. We see a
niche in programming education somewhere in between a bootcamp and a full master's degree. We think bootcamps focus too much
on high level frameworks and not enough on low level fundamentals, at the same time we think that a full master's program is a
bit too theoretical and lengthy for people looking to get into the industry as soon as possible.

# Our Method

Our goal is for you to start writing interesting programs. We believe most learning comes from writing programs yourself, so we only teach you the fundamental tools to get there. Problems are at the end of each section. Read through in order and try to work through the problems.

## Contact Us

If you are interested in going through our program please email us at beaconprogramming@gmail.com and we will get back to you as soon as we can. We are looking to get a small batch of people to go through our first program so let us know!

# Bouncing Ball

With Javascript and Canvas we can build games and animations. These tools allow us to create just about anything we can imagine.

## The Goal

The bouncing ball demo shows you how to create a program by first solving the simplest case and then increasing the complexity one piece at a time. This is the approach we want to take for all the programs we write. Our goal is to understand each piece that makes up the whole as well as the process of arriving there.

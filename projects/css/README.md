# CSS Basics

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) provides us with a way to describe how the HTML should be rendered. For example, CSS allows us to align text, change colors, and even animate!

## The Goal

Our goal is to understand the very basics of CSS enough to style the projects we will build to look a little nicer.

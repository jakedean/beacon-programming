# Simple Page

Javascript runs in the browser. In all the projects we build we will be using Javascript to interact with the HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) of the page. We should be comfortable with the basics of HTML before we dive into building fun and interesting programs with Javascript.

## The Goal

Our goal is to understand the concepts of HTML well enough to build a basic webpage. They won't look pretty because CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the tool used for that job. We will cover that in another lesson.

### Background
I am sure you have played tic tac toe, but for those of you that have not the rules are:
- Two players play against each other, with one player using an 'x' for their moves and the other user a 'y'
- Turns alternate where each player selects and open tile on the game board until one player has 3 of their
  pieces in a row or there are no open tiles.

For this we will use HTML and Canvas to draw the board.  We will use JS to provide the logic to see if
either player has won the game and to accept the clicks of the user and add the correct tiles to the board
as the game moves.

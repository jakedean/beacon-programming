# Overview

* Repo to hold our site for teaching programming.  We will have information in the basics section and projects in the projects section.
  If you are brand new you should read over the basics and try the problems at the end of the sections before trying any of the projects.
  If you have some experience you could jump into the projects and use the basics as a reference.

* Check out the `/docs/README.md` for more info, or go straight to beaconprogramming.com to see a formatted version!
